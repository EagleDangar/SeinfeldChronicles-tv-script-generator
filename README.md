## About

In this project I built very interesting Deep learning model based on RNNs(LSTM) which will be powerful enough to generate a fake TV-script on Seinfield American TV series.

This project is divided in the following key sections:

1. Processing image data, building a pipeline to extract important facial data from source.
2. Define a Deep learning network called DCGAN and training against the train data set.

you'll be able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; your generated samples should look like fairly interesting script.
